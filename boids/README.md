<h1>Boids</h1>
<p>Boids were first introduced by a computer scientist Craig Reynolds in the late 1980's. Reynolds came up with a set of simple behavioral rules for agents moving in a continuous space that can reproduce an amazingly natural looking flock behavior for birds. His model was called bird-oids or "Boids" for short. Boids are also used to model how schools of fish move or how swarms of insects move.</p>
